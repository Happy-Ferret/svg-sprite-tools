# svg-sprite-tools
Tools for packing, unpacking, and using SVG sprites (i.e. `<symbol>`'s)

Written in PHP. Uses the SimpleDOM library (included).

## svg-sprite-unpack
Takes a svg-sprite package (such as those generated by http://icomoon.io) and exports the individual SVG files.

## svg-sprite-pack
Takes 1 or more SVG files as input, outputs as svg-sprite package.

It uses the `<title></title>` element to figure out what the `id` should be. If no title is present, or they conflict, an error will be reported. 

Like icomoon, if title is "asset", the `id` will be `icon-asset`. If you want to change this, change `$id_prefix` at the top of the file.

### Cross Browser Assumptions
* `<defs></defs>` is not needed 
* `xmlns='blah'` attributes are not needed (invalid XML, but SVG is SVG)
* File can begin with `<svg>` instead of an XML header

## svg-sprite-css
Takes an svg-sprite package and generates a CSS file containing new widths, for any icon that isn't square (icons are assumed to be 1em by 1em). This CSS code will correct the aspect ratio.

# Using sprites
```xml
<svg class="icon icon-banana"><use xlink:href="#icon-banana"></use></svg>
```

Set the font-size to change the size of the icon.
