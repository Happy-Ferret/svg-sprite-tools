# svg-sprite-tools
A pair of tools for generating and exporting SVG sprites (i.e. `<symbol>`'s)

Written in PHP. Uses the SimpleDOM library (included).

## svg-sprite-export
Takes a pre-packed svg-sprite package (such as those generated by http://icomoon.io) and exports the individual SVG files.

## svg-sprite-pack
Takes 1 or more SVG files as input, outputs as svg-sprite package.

It uses the `<title></title>` element to figure out what the `id` should be. If no title is present, or they conflict, an error will be reported. 

Like icomoon, if title is "asset", the `id` will be `icon-asset`. If you want to change this, change `$id_prefix` at the top of the file.
